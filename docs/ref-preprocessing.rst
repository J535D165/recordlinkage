Preprocessing
=============

Cleaning and preprocessing your data may increase your record linkage
accuracy. The Python Record Linkage Toolkit contains several tools for data
cleaning and preprocessing. Some of the tools included are: phonetic encoding
algorithms and string cleaning tools. The tools are included in the submodule
``preprocessing``. (Import example: ``from recordlinkage.preprocessing import 
clean, phonenumbers``)
