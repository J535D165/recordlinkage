# Python Record Linkage Toolkit contrib

Any code in this directory is not officially supported, and may change or be
removed at any time without notice. It is meant to contain algorithms and
contributions that eventually should get merged into core of the toolkit, but
whose interfaces may still change, or which require some testing to see
whether they can find broader acceptance.
